# CLE Second Assignment

The objective of this project was to take the general problems, which have been discussed in the lab classes and for which we have developed a multithreaded solution. The aim now was to convert them into a multiprocess message passing application using the MPI library and running under Linux.

## Course
This labs were developed under the [Large Scale Computing](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/13638) course of [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt/).

## Libraries

This project implements the **MPI (Message Passing Interface library**.

## How to run
You can find the running steps inside the `README.md` file, on each problems directory.
